1. Ontology: The things that are important include the headers which contain the names of each student, and the general information presented on them in paragraph form- their education, employment, and other. 

2. Taxonomy: The name of the student is presented larger at the top to ensure that the user knows the main subject of the information below. Each of the paragraphs are presented with a consistant headers outlining their topic. Students are listed in with the odd student out first, then the two other students who are similar. Consistancy is ensured between each page through headers and equal lengths of content. All tags chosen to represent the content used. 

3. Choreography: The top most thing presented was the individual's name, to ensure that it was clear who the webpage was about. Following this, was an image of the individual, to give to user a visual representation of who they are reading about. Then, we inlcuded the paragraph describing the student. Everything is listed directly down, to make it easy for a user to navigate and make their way through the site.
