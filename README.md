1. Ontology: The things that are important include the headers which contain the names of each student, and the general information presented on them in paragraph form- their education, employment, and other. 

2. Taxonomy: The name of the student is presented larger at the top to ensure that the user knows the main subject of the information below. Each of the paragraphs are presented with a consistant headers outlining their topic. Students are listed in with the odd student out first (the girl is the odd one out among two other boys), then the two other students who are similar. Consistancy is ensured between each page through headers and equal lengths of content. All tags chosen to represent the content used. 

3. Choreography: The top most thing presented was the individual's name, to ensure that it was clear who the webpage was about. Following this, was an image of the individual, to give to user a visual representation of who they are reading about. Then, we inlcuded the paragraph describing the student. Everything is listed directly down, to make it easy for a user to navigate and make their way through the site. 

CSS Info (Coder - Julia Myers):

Use of Gutenberg Rule:

1. Home page = Z pattern: Your eye starts in the top left corner where the page heading is, it is then brought over to the left where the navigation buttons ("Home" and "Profile") are, then, you are taken down and to the right where the 3 pictures are, and finally over to the left where the links to the original webpages can be found - thus leading your eyes in a Z shape. I formatted the 3 pictures of the students together to form the "hero" of the page.

2. Profiles page = F pattern: On this page, your eye starts in the top left again where the page header is, and is again then taken to the right where 
the navigation buttons are.  Then, your eye is taken back to the left where the information about the people (I put that on the left side because it is 
more important for them to read about them than to focus on the pictures which I put on the right) The eye is sometimes taken to the right where a picture
is and then is brought down the page where the rest of the information is typed out.  So, the eye is taken in an F shape. 

C.R.A.P Principals:

Contrast - I implemented contrast into the design through type design and colors. On the index page, the header is the most bold which makes it stand out the most.  Next, the navigation buttons are white to contrast the black background, and the links to the original profile pages are white and underlined to contrast the black backgound and show that they are links.  On the Profiles page, the same contrast is applied to the header and navigation buttons.  The H2s are then a different font and have borders so that the names of the students (the most important info) are easily seen and remembered, the H3s are then underlines to distinguish themselves from the normal text in the paragraphs. 

Repetition - Repetition was implemented through colors, and formtting.  I decided on a blue/gray scale color scheme because I feel that those are calming and complimenting colors that are easy on the eyes.  That color scheme is repeated across both pages.  I also repeated the same fonts for all the H1s, all the H2s, all the H3s, and all the Ps to keep the pages consistent and complimentary

Alignment - I worked very hard to ensure that the text on the pages were aligned properly.  I aligned the pictures together on the home page to form a "hero" image.  I also aligned the aside on the home page with the "profiles" button in the navigation to make it look more polished and centered the links to the students' pages under "Profiles". On the Profiles page, I aligned all of the headers consistently and have indentations to signal the beginning of each paragraph. The pictures are all also aligned inline on the left border so that the reader sees the info first and then the picture (because the info is more important than the pictures).  Finally, I ensured that all of the pages were aligned in the center of the screen and did not stretch all the way to the borders of the screen.

Proximity - I placed the three images on the home page together in order to form one "hero" image for the page. I also made sure that they links to their own pages were in close proximity to the "Profiles" title (they are right below it) so that it was clear that hte links brought you to their profiles.  Lastly, I made sure that the images on the profiles page where in close proximity to the headings with their names so that you can tell whos picture is who.
