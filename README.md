1. Ontology: The things that are important include the headers which contain the names of each student, and the general information presented on them in paragraph form- their education, employment, and other. 

2. Taxonomy: The name of the student is presented larger at the top to ensure that the user knows the main subject of the information below. Each of the paragraphs are presented with a consistant headers outlining their topic. Students are listed in with the odd student out first (the girl is the odd one out among two other boys), then the two other students who are similar. Consistancy is ensured between each page through headers and equal lengths of content. All tags chosen to represent the content used. 

3. Choreography: The top most thing presented was the individual's name, to ensure that it was clear who the webpage was about. Following this, was an image of the individual, to give to user a visual representation of who they are reading about. Then, we inlcuded the paragraph describing the student. Everything is listed directly down, to make it easy for a user to navigate and make their way through the site. 

CSS Info (Designer - Julia Myers):

Use of Gutenberg Rule:

1. Index page = Z pattern: 
  - eye starts in the primary area (top left corner) where the  heading "Team Alicante" is. I placed this in the top left because it is important that the first thing the user sees when they open the webpage is our team name.  
   - eye then goes to the strong follow section (top right) where "Odd Student Out" is.  I put that there because it is relevant info to the page/assignment but isnt very important to the viewer.  
   - eyes then travel across the hero image to the weak section (bottom left).  The "CSC 174" footer is here because again, it is relevant info but not very important for the user.
   - finally, eyes move across to the terminal section (bottom right). I put the button with the link to the next page there because it is the "next action" which is very important.

2. Profiles page = F pattern: 
  - eye starts on the top left side where the header and the first name/paragraph is.  I put the paragraph about the student on the far left because that gets the most eye traffic and it is most importatn for the user to actually read about the students - so putting that there ensures that the reader will pay most attention to it
  - the title "Team Alicante" is also in the top left because it is the link back to the index page which is very important
  - the picture of the student is then to the right which brings the users eye across the page. I put the picture next because it is good for the user to be able to put a face to a name but it is secondary to actually reading about them
  - the button that links to their personal pages is on the far right.  This drags the users eyes further across the page but is the least important aspect so i put it on the far right. It is important to provide the link but I want users to stay on our site so I didnt want to put an external link in a more important area.
  - fianlly the footer on the bottom brings the eye down creating the bottom of the "F". I put this here because it is the least important aspect of the page and that section of the page does not get much eye traffic.

C.R.A.P Principals:

Contrast:
  - most important example of Contrast was my styling of the images on the idex page. I outlined the two male pictures in blue and the one female picture in pink so that they contrasted and it was obvious that the "odd student out" was the one girl among two boys.
   - I also added a hover detail to the buttons and the header on the profiles page so that when the user hovers over them, the color of the text changes to blue so the user knows that the text is a link.
   - I also used 2 fonts to add contrast between the headers and the paragraph text. I did this to draw the eye to the headers and emphasize their importance to the user.  I chose two fonts that were listed as complimentary on Google Fonts.  I choose that pair because they are professional which matches the content of the website which is mainly the academic interests of the students.

Repetition:
  - I used the same border colors on the pictures on the second page to have consistency and emphasize that the girl (among two boys) was the odd student out.
  - i also used the same color scheme throughout which was a greyscale. I chose a greyscale because it is professional and neutral which matched the content of the website since it is mainly about the students' academic work and interests.

Alignment:
  - I aligned the pictures together on the home page to form a "hero" image with different color borders. I did this to bring attention to the fact that the girl was the odd student out (because the other two are boys)
  - ensured that all of the pages were aligned in the center of the screen and did not stretch all the way to the borders of the screen. I did this to make sure that the content was readable for the user
  - i worked very hard to align the columns on the second page.  The reason I did this was to create the "F" pattern and to make sure that the most important parts of the website (the paragraphs) were in the areas with the most eye traffic (left side) followed by the secon most important part (the pictures), and finally the button with the external link. I worked hard to have these all align properly so that the page looked polished and readable for the user.

Proximity:
  - I put together the three images on the first page so that I could form a hero image for the index page
  - I put the buttons with the external links to their personal websites in the same column as their picture and info so that the user could easily find it and associate the links to the right students - makes the site easier to use and readable
