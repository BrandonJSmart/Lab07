	<h2>Xinyi Chen</h2>
		<h3>Story of Xinyi</h3>	
			<p>Xinyi is a digital media study undergraduate student of University of Rochester. She is also trying to major or minor in Spanish. She is a person who is not really specialized or skilled in any specific field but always willing to try something new. Xinyi is not sure if it is a good idea exploring around different possibilities and not commit herself in one particular subject, but she understands this is what college is for. Her computer science skill includes basic HTML, CSS, python. Her hobbies include cooking weird food, drawing grotesque, speaking a little chin-span-glish, and chin-span-urk.</p>
		
   		<h3>Personal:</h3>
   			<p>Xinyi has been living in Beijing, the capital of China for the past 15 years and this is her first years living in U.S. Her primary language is Chinese, but the first language she learned was Cantonese, even though she already forget everything. Beijing is a gigantic city full of spectaculars. You can see the relic of the ancient empire standing in between metropolitan skyscrapers. You can taste authentic local food from all over the China, since 70% of the population is originally from the outside of Beijing. Growing up in Beijing, she was deeply influenced by its environment - unsettled, always craving for change and refinement, and open to new ideas.</p>
	
    		<h3>Jobs:</h3>
    			<p>Rochester is a peaceful, nice small town for Xinyi, even though her former roommate from upstate New York told her it is actually a “city”. She did manage to some jobs to do by fortune. Currently, Xinyi is working as a teaching assistant in CSC170, and a note-taker in AME294 this semester. She never had a job here before in the U.S. In Beijing, she used to teach and took care kids from high school and primary school. She never had a job which is not related to education, though she really wants to become a coffee shop owner deeply inside her heart. She believes every job merits equally, regardless how many people you serve, what you do, how many dollars float. Because what really matters is that she gains a sense of achievement and respect herself.</p>
	
		<h3>Academics:</h3>
			<p>She has taken courses from various subjects. She has taken all of the four digital media study core courses. She also took writing and Middle East dance the first semester of her freshman year. She took two elementary Spanish courses and currently enrolled in intermediate Spanish class. She explored and took elementary Turkish her second semester in freshman year, however the professor is leaving the university and all of the Turkish language courses had to be cancelled. In this semester, she is taking resistant literature of the middle east, advanced front-end web developing, revolution in sound, and introduction to book publishing. </p>

	<h2>Jonathan Roman</h2>
		<h3>Story of Jonathan</h3>	
			<p>Jonathan is from Tenafly, NJ and was born September 6th, 1997. He currently attends to the University of Rochester with a major in Computer Science. His hobbies include playing video games and basketball, both of which he participates in groups around campus.</p>
   		
		<h3>Personal:</h3>
			<p>His hobbies slightly changed when he arrived to college. He, for the most part, stopped playing tennis and picked up basketball as his favorite sport. Since then he has tried to play nearly every day, and he is currently the captain of the men's club basketball team here at the University of Rochester. It's been a very different experience to transition from an individually dependent sport such as tennis to a fully organized team sport like basketball. It's been a learning experience and really has helped him grow as a person in regards to his ability to work well with other people / teammates. His interest in gaming remains mostly unchanged, and he is still keeping up to date with all the changing information in that industry.</p>	
    		
		<h3>Jobs:</h3>
    			<p>Throughout high school he would work as a part-time tennis coach, though mostly had very light hours (about 4-5 hours a week). The hours were fairly flexible and he could pick up lessons whenever his local tennis club was teaching them, allowing him to change my schedule regularly as needed. At the time he was on the varsity tennis team so the only prerequisite he needed was to be able to play and have the patience to deal with children aged anywhere from 6-14. This was his first job he received on my own as well, which was different but educational for a 15-year-old Jonathan. Over the summer, he also taught at the summer camp which was a lot more demanding, as the hours would often be, besides for certain exceptions, 9am-4pm.He has also worked as a warehouse employee for his dad, he would often be moving and packaging boxes and/or searching for items that needed to be shipped in the warehouse in order to package. Although it was not the most entertaining job in the world, he learned a lot about his dad's company and would be able to spend a lot of time working with his siblings along with my dad.</p>
		
		<h3>Academics:</h3>
			<p>As far as his academic career used to be, he was very into biology in high school. He would attend science competitions and fairs to present research he had begun through a special science research program in his school (which he credits his acceptance to the University of Rochester to). Since he was still a teenager, he had not really explored many fields up to this point and although the idea of biology excited him, he does not believe he was truly passionate about it. He had always been into video games and technology since he was old enough to operate a screen, so it seemed logical that he would like computer science, but his school did not offer anything in the field, so he entered the University of Rochester with a major in biology. Once he arrived at college, he continued with my track for a year or two before he began taking classes in computer science and instantly fell in love with it. He did not realize how much he would truly enjoy the field but he is extremely happy he ended up being able to complete his major within the 4 years even with some extra classes from other fields under his belt.</p>

	<h2>Renjie Xiao</h2>
		<h3>Story of Renjie</h3>	
			<p>Renjie is an international student currently major in Business Analytics and minor in Computer Science at the University of Rochester. Before that, he completed his high school at Walsingham Academy in a little town named Williamsburg. He has lived and studied in Shanghai, China for 16 years.</p>
		
   		<h3>Personal:</h3>
   			<p>In 2012, he came to the states at 16 years old as an exchange student in Williamsburg. Living in Shanghai for his entire live, he has never left his family for longer than a week. So, coming to a totally different country and study excited and frighten him at the same time. The culture shock really got to him the first few weeks, but gradually he adjusted into the American culture with the help of friendly classmates and his host parents. For the three years in Walsingham Academy, one thing that help him the most was being part of the tennis team. He did not know how to play when he first started, and his English wasn’t good enough to let him communicate with others. That depressed him quite a bit because he can only watch my teammates play on matches while he sat on the bench. Weeks later, with the help of his coach, he finally got the hang of it and his social skills improved with his tennis skills.  With the confidence he gained from success in tennis, graduated with honor and got accepted into University of Rochester.</p>
	
    		<h3>Jobs:</h3>
    			<p>For the summer of his sophomore year, he applied for an internship at an asset management company in Shanghai. As he started as an equity research intern in this company, he learned multiple ways to analyze a company and its stock price to see if they are worthy to invest. On the other hand, he has gained interest on business analyst from many internal meetings, which is to use big data and programming to predict future movement of stocks. After he did more research on business analyst, and taking some classes in it, he decided to switch his major into business analyst.</p>
	
		<h3>Academics:</h3>
			<p>In 2015, he came to Rochester to pursue his bachelor’s degree. Started off the college academics taking ECO 108 with Pr. Rizzo, Renjie soon gained great interest in the field of economics because he made the class interesting and easy to understand. After taking more courses with him, he declared his major as Financial Economics at the end of the sophomore year. At that time, he thought economics will be his greatest passion in the future.Besides the normal programming classes, he has also found interest in website design after taking CSC170, which was an awesome course to introduce the world of web design.  During this class, he has learned so much about HTML, CSS and JS. He also learned how to put these components together and make them as a workable website. After that, he decided to add computer science as his minor and continue to build up more knowledge about web design by taking more advanced classes such as csc174.</p>
